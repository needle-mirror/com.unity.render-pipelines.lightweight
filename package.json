The technology offers graphics that are scalable to mobile platforms, and you can also use it for higher-end consoles and PCs. You\u2019re able to achieve quick rendering at a high quality without needing compute shader technology. LWRP uses simplified, physically based Lighting and Materials. The LWRP uses single-pass forward rendering. Use this pipeline to get optimized real-time performance on several platforms.",
